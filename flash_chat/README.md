A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

If the app fails to build with a cocoapods error, it's not the cocoa pods, just
run `flutter build ios --release --no-codesign` in the terminal this should solve the issue when you run it a second time from the similator runner the vscode pluging (Android iOS Emulator).
